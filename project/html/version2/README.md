This is the second version of the website edited by Owen. New changes include:
1. Added an admin page. It can be accessed by entering admin credentials into the login page
2. The admin page includes a list of current normal users (non-admins)
3. Each user has a delete button that, upon pressing, will remove them from the list of users and wipe them from session memory
4. All memory is linked to the session, so once the website is relaunched, hard coded user credentials will reappear
